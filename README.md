## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned how to declare global css variables. I also started to make comments on my code so it is easier to understand and follow. 

`
```css
:root {
    --main-background: hsl(233, 47%, 7%);
    --card-background: hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
    --accent: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
    --white-heading: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --white-paragraph: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
    --white-statistics: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.6);
}
```

### Continued development

I haven't created anything with mobile yet. Here I tried it, but I don't think I did it right. Further improvement on mobile first design and media queries is needed! I was also having trouble with overlay. I solved this by using .svg rectangle, coloring it, added border-radius and used filters. I'm sure there is another way to do this.
